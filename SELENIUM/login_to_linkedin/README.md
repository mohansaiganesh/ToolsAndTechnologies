Here we are using selenium to login to linkedin.

Initially we go to the url https://www.linkedin.com/login from chrome web driver.
We will wait until the 'body' element is loaded.
Once it is loaded we will send the username and password fields to the corresponding inputs.
We finally proceed to feed, once there is a successful login.
